This is a simple to use framework which we use internally. We decided to make it free for everyone!

Installation
------------

If you are cloning this repository you will more then likely need to copy it into the working 
folder of your Unity project, unless you've included it in as a submodule on your own GIT repo.

A good tutorial for submodules can be found here:

If you've downloaded the Asset Store version, its already installed for you :)
